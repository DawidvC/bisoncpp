0.98.007

Added a README.flex file giving some background information about the provided
implementation of the lexical scanner (bisonc++/scanner/yylex.cc)

Modified the compilation scripts: bisconc++/flex/FlexLexer.h is now 
included by default. This FlexLexer.h file is expected by
bisonc++/scanner/yylex.cc and by the Scanner class. 

Simplified some compilation scripts.
