bisonc++ (0.98.003) unstable; urgency=low

  * Incomplete default State constructor now explicitly defined, prevents
    the incidental erroneous rapporting of conflicts for some states.

bisonc++ (0.98.002) unstable; urgency=low

  * The Wrap1 configurable unary predicate template class replaces various
    other templates (WrapStatic, Wrap, Pred1Wrap). No further usage or
    implementation changes/modifications.

bisonc++ (0.98.001) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is a complete rewrite of the former bisonc++ (0.91) version. The
    program bisonc++ is now a C++ program, producing C++ sources, using the
    algorithm for creating LALR-1 grammars as outlined by Aho, Sethi and
    Ullman's (1986) `Dragon' book. The release number will remain 0.98 for a
    while, and 0.98.001 holds the initial package, new style. Also see the
    man-page, since some things have been changed (augmented) since the
    previous version. No dramatic changes in the grammar specification method:
    Bisonc++ still uses bison's way to specify grammars, but some features,
    already obsolete in bisonc++ 0.91 were removed.

    Also note my e-mail address: the U. of Groningen's official policy now is
    to remove department specific information, so it's `@rug.nl' rather than
    `@rc.rug.nl', as used before.

bisonc++ (0.91) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added several missing short options (like -B etc) to the getopt() function
    call. I forgot to add them to the previous version(s). Internally, all old
    C style allocations were changed to C++ style allocations, using operators
    new and delete. Where it was immediately obvious that a vector could be
    used, I now use vectors. The internally used types `core' `shifts' and
    'reductions' (types.h) now use a vector data member rather than an int [1]
    member, which is then allocated to its proper (I may hope) size when the
    structs are allocated.

bisonc++ (0.90) unstable; urgency=low

  * Command-line options now override matching declarations specified in the
    grammar specification file.

    All %define declarations have been removed. Instead their first arguments
    are now used to specify declarations. E.g., %parser-skeleton instead of
    %define parser-skeleton.

    All declarations use lower-case letters, and use only separating hyphens,
    no underscores. E.g., %lsp-needed rather than %define LSP_NEEDED
    The declaration %class-name replaces the former %name declaration

    All yy and YY name prefixes of symbols defined by bisonc++ have been
    removed. The parser-state `yydefault' has been renamed to `defaultstate'.

bisonc++ (0.82) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added d_nError as protected data member to the base class. Missed it
    during the initial conversion. d_nErrors counts the number of parsing
    errors. Replaces yynerrs from bison(++)

bisonc++ (0.81) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added the option --show-files to display the names of the files that are
    used or generated by bisonc++.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rc.rug.nl>  Fri, 28 Jan 2005 14:50:48 +0100

bisonc++ (0.80) unstable; urgency=low

  * Completed the initial debian release. No changes in the software.

bisonc++ (0.70-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release.
