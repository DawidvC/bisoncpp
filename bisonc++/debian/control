Description: Bison-style parser generator for C++ 
 Bisonc++ was designed after `bison++', created by Alain Coetmeur. Bisonc++
 adds to this a cleaner class-design, in which a base-class is offered to
 communicate lexical tokens to a lexical scanner. 
 .
 Since bisonc++ generates the parser class as well as the parsing
 function. The class can easily be provided with additional members without
 the need to resort to polymorphic functions. Consequently, classes
 generated by bisonc++ have no virtual members and actually have but one
 public member: parse(), that replaces the old-style yyparse() function.
 .
 Bisonc++ offers many options, among which an option to define classes
 generated by bisonc++ in a separate namespace. Bisonc++ generates C++
 code. If C code is required, bison should be used.
 .
 In addition to the bisconc++ parser generator itself and several skeleton
 files, the package contains an extensive man-page, a full manual rewritten
 after the original bison manual, and several examples.
