Description: Bison-style parser generator for C++
 Bisonc++ was designed after `bison++' by Alain Coetmeur. Bisonc++ adds to
 this a cleaner class-design, in which a base-class is offered to communicate
 lexical tokens to a lexical scanner. Since bisonc++ generates the parser
 class, there is no real need for virtual members. Consequently, they have
 been removed from classes generated by bisonc++. By default, the class
 generated by bisonc++ has only one public member: parse(), replacing the
 old-style yyparse() function.  Bisonc++ offers many options, among which the
 possibility to define the class in a separate namespace. Bisonc++ merely
 generates C++ code. If C code is required, bison should be used.
