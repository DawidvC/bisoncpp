The scanner (as implemented by, e.g., bf(flexc++)(1)) recognizes input
patterns, and returns Parser tokens (e.g., Parser::INT) matching the
recognized input. It is easily created by tt(flexc++) from the following
simple specification file.
        verbinclude(poly/scanner/lexer)

The reader may refer to bf(flexc++)(1) documentation for details about
bf(flexc++)(1) specification files.
