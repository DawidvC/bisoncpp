A em(reentrant) program is one which does not alter in the course of
execution; in other words, it consists entirely of pure (read-only)
code. Reentrancy is important whenever asynchronous execution is possible; for
example, a nonreentrant program may not be safe to call from a signal
handler. In systems with multiple threads of control, a nonreentrant program
must be called only within interlocks.

Currently, B() generates a parser which is em(not) reentrant. There are
no plans to change this in the near future.
