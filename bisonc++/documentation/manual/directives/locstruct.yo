 bf(%locationstruct) tt(struct-definition) nl() 
           Defines the organization of the location-struct data type
            bf(LTYPE). This struct should be specified analogously to the way
            the parser's stacktype is defined using bf(%union) (see
            below). The location struct is named bf(LTYPE). If neither
            bf(locationstruct) nor bf(LTYPE) is specified, the aforementioned
            default struct is used.
