Syntax: bf(%locationstruct) tt(struct-definition) 

Defines the organization of the location-struct data type bf(LTYPE_). This
struct should be specified analogously to the way the parser's stacktype is
defined using bf(%union) (see below). The location struct type is named
bf(LTYPE_). If neither bf(locationstruct) nor bf(LTYPE_) is specified, the
default link(LTYPE_)(LSPNEEDED) struct is used.
