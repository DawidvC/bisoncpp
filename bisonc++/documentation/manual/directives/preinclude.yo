     Syntax: bf(%baseclass-preinclude) tt(header)nl()
           Use tt(header) as the pathname to the file pre-included in the
            parser's base-class header. See the description of the
            link(--baseclass-preinclude)(PREINCLUDE) option for details about
            this directive. The filename tt(header) will by default be
            surrounded by double quotes; it's OK, however, to provide them
            yourself.  When the argument is surrounded by em(pointed brackets)
            tt(#include <header>) will be included.
