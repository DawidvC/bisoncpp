     bf(%baseclass-preinclude) tt(header)nl()
           Use tt(header) as the pathname to the file pre-included in the
            parser's base-class header. See the description of the
            bf(--baseclass-preinclude) option for details about this option.
            Like the convention adopted for this argument, tt(header) will (by
            default) be surrounded by double quotes.  However, when the
            argument is surrounded by pointed brackets tt(#include <header>)
            will be included.
