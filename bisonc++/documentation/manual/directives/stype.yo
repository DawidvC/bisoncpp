bf(%stype typename) nl()    
           The type of the semantic value of tokens.  The specification
            tt(typename) should be the name of an unstructured type (e.g.,
            bf(unsigned)). By default it is bf(int). See bf(YYSTYPE) in
            bf(bison).  It should not be used if a bf(%union) specification is
            used.  Within the parser class, this type may be used as
            bf(STYPE).
