 bf(%ltype typename) nl()    
           Specifies a user-defined token location type. 
           If bf(%ltype) is used, tt(typename) should be the name of an
            alternate (predefined) type (e.g., bf(size_t)). It should not be
            used if a bf(%locationstruct) specification is used (see
            below). Within the parser class, this type may be used as
            bf(LTYPE).
