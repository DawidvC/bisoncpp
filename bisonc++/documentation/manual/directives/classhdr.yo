    Syntax: bf(%class-header) tt(filename) nl()
           tt(Filename) defines the name of the file to contain the parser
            class. Defaults to the name of the parser class plus the suffix
            tt(.h) This directive is overruled by the bf(--class-header)
            (bf(-c)) command-line option.

           A warning is issued if this directive is used and an already
            existing implementation header file does not contain tt(#include
            "filename").
