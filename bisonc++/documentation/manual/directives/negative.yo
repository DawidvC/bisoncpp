    bf(%negative-dollar-indices) nl()
           Accept (do not generate warnings) zero- or negative dollar-indices
            in the grammar's action blocks. Zero or negative
            dollar-indices are commonly used to implement inherited
            attributes, and should normally be avoided. When used, they can be
            specified like tt($-1) or tt($<type>-1), where tt(type) is a
            tt(%union) field-name. See also the sections ref(ACTIONS) and
            ref(SPECIAL).
