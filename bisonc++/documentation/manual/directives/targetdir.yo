Syntax: bf(%target-directory) tt(pathname) nl()
           tt(Pathname) defines the directory where generated files should be
            written.  By default this is the directory of bic()'s input file.
            The tt(--target-directory) option does not affect files whose
            locations were explicitly defined (either using options or
            directives). This directive is overruled by the
            tt(--target-directory) command-line option.
