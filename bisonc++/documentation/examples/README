Examples, how to use them and what they do:

Some examples call bisonc++ from the tmp/bin directory. Thus they can be run
after executing make/program. The `build' scripts in which this happens also
have a standard BISONC definition, calling bisonc++ from its standard
location. Bij commenting out the BISONC definition calling tmp/bin/bisonc++
the standard bisonc++ can be called.

Most examples available before version 1.00 are now in the ../regression
directory, where they are most easily used by runnning the `run' script.

bison++Example.NEW: The original example provided by Alain Coetmeur.

        compile by running `make'
        The program can be run by having it read test1.txt or test2.txt from
        its stdin.
        It has no other purpose (as far as I can see).

        Included as a collector's item only. Doesn't work as-is.

annotations: The parser evaluating int and double and mixed type expressions,
        as described in the `Concrete Examples' chapter of the C++
        Annotations. It converts expressions to RPN.

        Run `build clean' to cleanup, `build demo' to create the program.

calcgen:  A simple calculator. Enter expressions using +, -, *, /, () on a
        line, and then press Enter. Errors are recovered by skipping to the
        next newline. Empty lines are ok. Terminate by entering  q

        Run `build clean' to cleanup, `build demo' to create the program.

calculator: the example described in the man-page has moved to
        `man/calculator' 

conflict: Not a running program, but a grammar showing various conflicts and
        the way bisonc++ resolves them. 

        Run `build clean' to cleanup, `build demo' to generate the files
        
input:   a simple parser reading numbers or names following a prompt. Enter
        ^D (or a syntactical error) to stop the program.

        Run `build clean' to cleanup, `build demo' to create the program.

error:      moved to `regression'

location:   moved to `regression'

simpledemo: moved to `regression' as the example `simplecalc'
