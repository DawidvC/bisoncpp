- %nonassoc should probably produce an error when %nonassoc operators are used
  repeatedly. 

block.h: skip should expect std::string const &, see also skip-calls in
e.g. lexer.  Same for Block constructor

Replace #include <map> by #include <unordered_map> in parser (?)

parser/handledollar handles the dollar indices.

To initialize $$ with %polymorphic use $$.reset(semantic__). Alternative:
    let semantic__ initialize d_val__ itself? 
    Would this prevent the isMember test?
