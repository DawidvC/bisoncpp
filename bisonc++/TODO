- With double reduction states (using REQ_RED states) the state table is
constructed incompletely. E.g.,
    expr:
        name
    |
        ident '(' ')'
    |
        (etc?)
    ;
    and:

    name:   
        IDENT
    ;
    ident:
        IDENT
    ;

    the state following IDENT is either a reduce to 'name' or 'ident': that
table appears to be filled incompletely, using the number of the token where
the token ('(') should be mentioned, and an empty field in the table itself.
This is not a RR conflict, but an incompletely filled table. Moreover, in
these situations d_val__ must be set by the scanner, since the reduction
requires another token, and only once that token is available the reduction
to, e.g., 'ident' can be performed, but at that time YYText() has already gone
in and action block like:

    ident:
        IDENT
        {
            $$ = d_scanner.YYText();
        }
    ;


    ** To be repaired **

- %nonassoc should probably produce an error when %nonassoc operators are used
  repeatedly.
