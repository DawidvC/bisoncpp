    The next item was removed from changelog and is not implemented, as it may
    result in perpetual error recovery. Needs repair. Relevant sections in
    bisonc++ are commented out.

  * The bisonc++.cc skeleton's error recovery procedure now saves the
    unexpected token, then matches the next _error_ state and reinserts the 
    unexpected token, which should now be recognized. The matching semantic
    value is also saved and reinstalled.

- %nonassoc should probably produce an error when %nonassoc operators are used
  repeatedly.
