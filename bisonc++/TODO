- %nonassoc should probably produce an error when %nonassoc operators are used
  repeatedly. 

block.h: skip should expect std::string const &, see also skip-calls in
e.g. lexer.  Same for Block constructor

Replace #include <map> by #include <unordered_map> in parser (?)

Still to do:
    - It would be nice if the semantic value ($s) would act like values, not
        as pointers. 
    - The tags are in ParserMeta__::Tag; maybe they should remain in the
        Parser's namespace.
This would allow for constructions like:
        $$.get<INT>() = $1.get<INT>()
instead of:
        $$->get<ParserMeta__::INT>() = $1->get<ParserMeta__::INT>()

Also, STYPE__ should allow for assignments:
        $$ = newSemantic(12)
instead of:
        $$.reset(newSemantic(12))
