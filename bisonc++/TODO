- %nonassoc should probably produce an error when %nonassoc operators are used
  repeatedly. 

scanner/scanner1.cc should use std::cerr as its output stream. Currently using
std::cout

block.h: skip should expect std::string const &, see also skip-calls in
e.g. lexer.  Same for Block constructor

void Parser::setStype(): uses string, old char const *
void Parser::setLtype(): uses string, old char const *

parser/parser1: calls set_debug for the scanner, see also scanner/scanner.h
