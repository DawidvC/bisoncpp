- %nonassoc should probably produce an error when %nonassoc operators are used
  repeatedly. 

block.h: skip should expect std::string const &, see also skip-calls in
e.g. lexer.  Same for Block constructor

Replace #include <map> by #include <unordered_map> in parser (?)

To initialize $$ with %polymorphic assign a permittable value.

NOTE in the manual/manpage that Tag__ is not a strongly type enum, which
allows simple references to the tags by their identifiers, but runs the risk
of confusing tokens with Tags. When they occur simple solutions exist:
    - rename the offending tags (e.g., STRING -> TEXT if there's also a STRING
                                 Token)
    - prefix the offending tags by their enum-name (Parser::STRING,
                                 Tag__::STRING) 

With %polymorphic:
$$. is recognized as calling a member for $$.  ($$). and comparable
constructions do not recognize a member call.

parser/replacedollar.cc is obsolete and can be removed
