To Install bisonc++ by hand instead of using the binary distribution perform
the following steps:

    1. Inspect the values of the variables in the file INSTALL.cf
       Modify these when necessary.

    2. Make sure the bobcat library has been installed. 

       (If you compile the bobcat library yourself, note that bisonc++ does
        not use the classes Milter and Xpointer; they may --as far as bisonc++
        is concerned-- be left out of the library)

    3. Run `./make/program' to compile bisonc++

        Note: it's NOT `make program'

    4. Run (probably as root) ./make/install to install

        Note: it's NOT `make install'

    Following the installation nothing in this directory tree is required
    for the proper functioning of bisonc++, so consider removing it.

NOTE that parser-class header files generated by bisonc++ before version 1.00
     should modify the prototypes of some of their private members. Simply
     replacing the `support functions for parse()' section shown at the end of
     the header file by the following lines should make your header file
     up-to-date again. Note that bisonc++ does not by itself rewrite the
     parser class headers to prevent undoing any modifications you may have
     implemented in parser-class header files:

    // support functions for parse():
        void executeAction(int ruleNr);
        void errorRecovery();
        int lookup();
        void nextToken();
