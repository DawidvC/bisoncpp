To Install bisonc++ by hand instead of using the binary distribution perform
the following steps:

    1. Inspect the values of the variables in the file INSTALL.cf
       Modify these when necessary.

    2. Make sure the bobcat library has been installed. 

       (If you compile the bobcat library yourself, note that bisonc++ does
        not use the classes Milter and Xpointer; they may --as far as bisonc++
        is concerned-- be left out of the library)

    3. Run `./make/program' to compile bisonc++

        Note: it's NOT `make program'

    4. Run (probably as root) ./make/install to install

        Note: it's NOT `make install'

    Following the installation nothing in this directory tree is required
    for the proper functioning of bisonc++, so consider removing it.
