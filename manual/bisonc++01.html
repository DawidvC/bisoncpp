<h1 >Chapter 1: Introduction</h1>
<strong >Bisonc++</strong> is a general-purpose parser generator converting grammar descriptions for
LALR(1) context-free grammars into <strong >C++</strong> classes whose members can parse
such grammars.  Once you are a proficient <strong >bisonc++</strong> user, you may use it to develop
a wide range of language parsers, from those used in simple desk calculators
to complex programming languages.
<p>
<strong >Bisonc++</strong> is highly comparable to the program bison++, written by Alain Coetmeur:
all properly-written bison++ grammars ought to be convertible to <strong >bisonc++</strong> grammars
requiring very little or no modifications.  Anyone familiar with bison++ or
its precursor, bison, should quickly be able to use <strong >bisonc++</strong> as well. <strong >Bisonc++</strong>
generates <strong >C++</strong> code, rather than <strong >C</strong> code, and so a fair knowledge of the
<strong >C++</strong> programming language is required before <strong >bisonc++</strong> can profitably be used.
<p>
This manual closely resembles <strong >bison</strong>(1)'s userguide. In fact, many sections
of that manual were copied straight into this manual. With <strong >bisonc++</strong> distributions
(both the full source distribution and the binary <code >.deb</code> distributions)
<strong >bison</strong>'s orginal manual is included in both <em >PostScript</em> and (converted
from the <code >texi</code> format) <code >HTML</code> format. Where necessary sections of the
original manual were adapted to <strong >bisonc++</strong>'s characteristics. Some sections were
removed, and some new sections were added to the current manual. Expect
upgrades of the manual to appear without further notice. Upgrades will be
announced in the manual's title.
<p>
The current manual starts with tutorial chapters that explain the basic
concepts of using <strong >bisonc++</strong> and use three examples illustrating some of the core
issues of LALR(1) grammars, each example building on the previous example
(where available).  If you don't know <strong >bisonc++</strong>, bison++ or bison, start by reading
these chapters.  Reference chapters follow describing specific aspects of <strong >bisonc++</strong>
in detail.
<p>
<strong >Bisonc++</strong> was designed and built by <a href="mailto:f.b.brokken@rug.nl">Frank
B. Brokken</a>. The program's first version was 
constructed between November 2004 and May 2005.

<h2 >1.1: What's new in version 5.00.01</h2>
    If you're new to <strong >bisonc++</strong>, you can safely skip this section. If you used <strong >bisonc++</strong>
before, please note the following new and modified features:
    <ul>
    <li> New option/directive <code >default-actions</code> controlling the addition of a
<code >$$ = $1</code> action blocks to non-empty production rules that do not themselves
define final action blocks. Option/directive <code >no-default-action-return</code> is
not supported anymore.
<p>
<li> New option/directive <code >tag-mismatches</code> issuing a warning if no
<code >$$</code> assignment was detected in the last (action block) elements of
production rules.
<p>
<li> New parser class enumeration <code >DebugMode__</code> and a new member
<code >setDebug(DebugMode__ mode)</code> that can be used to control debug output and to
show case label numbers of the parser's <code >executeAction</code> member just before
execution. This is useful in cases where a run-time mismatch between tags of
polymorphic semantic values are observed.
<p>
<li> The <code >SType::data</code> member functions are obsolete and were removed
from <code >SType's</code> class's interface (section <a href="bisonc++04.html#POLYMORPHIC">4.6.1</a> fully covers the
use and characteristics of polymorphic semantic values).
<p>
<li> The <code >SType::operator bool</code> member was replaced by a new member
function <code >bool SType::valid()</code>.
<p>
<li> The previously defined member <code >SType::emplace</code> was replaced by
<code >SType::assign</code>: it should be used to assign values to <code >SType</code> objects. If
only one argument is required, <code >operatpr=</code> can also be used (but may require
casting).
<p>
<li> Dollar-notations have been altered. The standard dollar-notations are
of course still available, but <code >$$(...), _$$, _$i</code> are new, while
<code >$&lt;tag&gt;$</code> and <code >$&lt;tag&gt;i</code> (for positive values of i) are no longer
supported. See section <a href="bisonc++04.html#ACTIONS">4.6.2</a> for a full overview.
    </ul>
<p>
At the implementation level polymorphic semantic values are not implemented
using <code >std::shared_ptr</code> objects. Moreover, polymorphic semantic value types
do not have to be default constructible anymore.
