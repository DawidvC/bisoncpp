>     I have the following request with respect to the Academic 
> Free License (AFL), of which I think you're the copyright 
> holder. If I'm mistaken, please accept my apologies for 
> bothering you and simply ignore the following.
> 
>     I use the AFL in several of the computer programs I've 
> constructed, and would like to include the AFL's text 
> explicitly in the documentation accompanying some of these 
> programs. In the AFL's final paragraph you state:
> 
>     ...Permission is hereby granted to copy and distribute 
> this license
>     without modification. This license may not be modified 
> without the express
>     written permission of its copyright owner.
> 
>     The AFL discusses 15 points, and several sub-points 
> (e.g., 1a, 1b, etc.). The original text enumerates these 
> points using closing parentheses, and because of that the 
> parentheses-count in the AFL is unbalanced. 
> 
>     It would be convenient for me if I could change these 
> closing parentheses into colons. E.g., rather than writing:
> 
>         1) Grant of Copyright License. ...
> 
>     I'd like to use:
> 
>         1: Grant of Copyright License. ...
> 
>     I appears to me that these modifications don't really 
> affect the document, so I would be grateful if you'd allow me 
> to use the thus modified AFL in my documentation.
